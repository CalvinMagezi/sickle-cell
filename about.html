          <h1>In a world with medical advancements, 
            high tech, and research institutions, it is absurd 
            that Sickle Cell Disease is not given the time and 
            attention it deserves.</h1>

        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
          <h5>Sickle Cell Warriors have seen it all amidst the 
            excruciating pain that they go through, they have to 
            advocate for themselves to get the medical attention 
            they deserve. Their pain is neglected, minimized and 
            dismissed as non-medical emergencies, from being 
            limited to numerous physical activities, to being 
            branded as drug addicts, It’s about time Sickle Cell 
            Warriors are treated with the right patient care.</h5>

          create awareness but to also improve on the bedside manner, 
          patient care and overall livelihoods of people living

          <h1>~Josephine Esisa~</h1>
          <h5>I was diagnosed with Sickle Cell Disease at 3 years old, Sickle Cell 
            Disease is a huge part of my life; i.e from something as basic
             as my outfit for the day, what I can and cannot eat or drink 
             to making plans, for the day, week or months or even the next 
             hour,, it somehow is embedded into every decision that I 
             make because of the unpredictability of the that comes 
             with being a Sickle Cell Warrior. 
             <br>
             <br>
             However I am privileged to have been born into a family of 
             medical practitioners, which had made living with Sickle Cell 
             Disease manageable, my privilege though a blessing is not 
             something that numerous warriors get to have or experience 
             in their battle. I realized that SCD is not given the attention 
             it needs compared to HIV/Cancer, doctors do not understand the 
             level of pain Warriors go through, we are not treated the same, 
             and when in it comes to society, not only do they not have a 
             clue, but they don’t have an idea on how to support a friend or 
             family member with Sickle Cell Disease. SCD is mentally, emotionally, 
             and physically draining, and can easily lead one down a rabbit hole. 
             <br>
             <br>
             S for Sickle Cell promotes and advocates using 
             natural modalities such as plant based nutrition, 
             holistic methods and health programs to ease and 
             alleviate Sickle Cell pain crisis’. 
             <br>
             <br>
             S for Sickle Cell is therefore a safe space for Warriors, 
             and their loved ones, educating and creating awareness with 
             a social and behavioral change goal towards SCD as the big 
             picture.~Josephine Esisa, Founder, S for Sickle Cell</h5>

            was about 10 years old when my parents decided to 
            move to the Eastern Cape in South Africa where the 
            lower altitude levels were more beneficial for my 
            wellbeing. I am a 29 year old with Sickle Cell 
            Anemia SS and I was diagnosed with Sickle Cell at 
            6 months old. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I have suffered a lot of Sickle Cell crises’ and 
            spent a lot of time in hospital being treated for 
            the pain. I have undergone major surgeries, two hip 
            replacements, because of my disease. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I come from a family of 2 brothers and 1 sister. Two 
            of my siblings suffer from Sickle Cell, one unfortunately 
            passed away. Despite my own physical and emotional 
            struggles, I try to do my job to my full potential 
            and be the best older sibling I can be for my younger siblings.

            <br>
            For the past 8 years I was living in California and was very 
            blessed to experience what great healthcare and awareness for 
            Sickle Cell Anemia should be like. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This cause is really important to me because being a Sickler

            one of the countries with the highest number of people with 
            Sickle Cell Disease, but has a reasonably poor healthcare 
            system for Sickle Cell patients or a level of awareness that 
            is not at a level that should be reasonable for such a 
            country. My goal and passion is to help improve lives of
